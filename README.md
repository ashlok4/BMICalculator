# React BMI Calculator

This is a React application that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your height and weight. It provides a user-friendly interface with sliders for input and displays the calculated BMI value.

## Features

* **Clear and concise input:** Users can easily enter their height (cm) and weight (kg) using sliders.
* **Real-time calculation:** The BMI is calculated automatically as the user adjusts the sliders.
* **Informative display:** The calculated BMI value is displayed prominently with one decimal place for clarity.
* **Optional BMI interpretation:** You can extend the code to interpret the BMI value (underweight, normal weight, overweight, etc.) based on standard guidelines.
